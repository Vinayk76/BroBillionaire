                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Starting Point:</strong> $50K initial + $1,000/month contributions = $410K invested over
                        30 years</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Rate:</strong> 20% annual return (conservative for Bro stocks) = $11.8M after 30
                        years</li>
                    <li><strong>Tax Optimization:</strong> Max Roth IRA + long-term holds = save $2M+ in lifetime taxes
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Passing Wealth:</strong> Trusts, step-up basis, education funding = preserve wealth for
                        kids/grandkids</li>
                    <li><strong>Reality:</strong> This requires discipline, zero panic selling, and ignoring 3-4 major
                        crashes</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h2><i class="fas fa-rocket"></i> The Math: How $50K Becomes $11.8M in 30 Years</h2>
                <p>Most people don't become wealthy because they don't understand <strong>compound growth</strong>. Let
                    me show you the magic:</p>
                <h3>The Setup:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial investment:</strong> $50,000</li>
                    <li><strong>Monthly contribution:</strong> $1,000 ($12K/year)</li>
                    <li><strong>Total contributions:</strong> $50K + ($12K × 30) = <strong>$410,000</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Annual return:</strong> 20% (historical Bro stock average)</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>The Outcome After 30 Years:</h3>
                <div style="text-align: center; font-size: 3rem; color: #4ade80; font-weight: 900; margin: 30px 0;">
                    $11,800,000</div>
                <p class="highlight-text" style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2rem;">You invested $410K. You made
                    $11.4M in gains. That's <strong>28x your money</strong>.</p>
                <h3>Why This Works:</h3>
                <p>Years 1-10: Slow grind. $410K grows to $1.2M (3x).</p>
                <p>Years 11-20: Acceleration. $1.2M becomes $4.8M (4x).</p>
                <p>Years 21-30: <strong>Exponential explosion.</strong> $4.8M becomes $11.8M (2.5x).</p>
                <p>This is compound interest. The last 10 years create more wealth than the first 20 combined.</p>
                <div class="warning-box">
                    <h3>What If Returns Are Lower?</h3>
                    <p><strong>15% annual return:</strong> $5.2M (still incredible)</p>
                    <p><strong>25% annual return:</strong> $30.4M (if you nail stock selection)</p>
                    <p><strong>10% annual return:</strong> $2.3M (S&P 500 equivalent)</p>
                    <p>Even "bad" Bro stock returns (15%) beat index funds by 2-3x.</p>

                <h4>Contrarian Take</h4>
                <p>Everyone's worried about Meta's metaverse spending. They should be. But what they miss is that Meta's
                    AI advertising engine is so far ahead, they can burn $10B yearly on moonshots and still dominate.

                <h3>Rule #1: Never Stop Contributing</h3>
                <p>$1,000/month for 30 years = $360K invested. Skip years 20-30? You lose $3M in final value.
                    <strong>Contributions matter most in the final decade.</strong>
                </p>
                <h3>Rule #2: Hold Through Every Crash</h3>
                <p>You will see 4-5 crashes. Each one will feel like the end. <strong>Survivors get rich. Sellers get
                        destroyed.</strong></p>
                <h3>Rule #3: Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts First</h3>
                <p>Roth IRA $7K/year for 30 years at 20% = $2.8M. <strong>Tax-free forever.</strong> Do this before
                    taxable accounts.</p>
                <h3>Rule #4: Rebalance, Don't Panic Sell</h3>
                <p>If Nvidia becomes 70% of your portfolio, trim to 40% and buy laggards. But <strong>never sell
                        everything.</strong> Rebalance ≠ exit.</p>
                <h3>Rule #5: Ignore FOMO and Meme Stocks</h3>
                <p>You don't need to chase the next Dogecoin or AMC. <strong>Boring, consistent Bro stocks</strong> will
                    make you $10M+ if you just hold.</p>
                <h3>Rule #6: Increase Contributions as Income Grows</h3>
                <p>Year 1: $500/month. Year 10: $1,500/month. Year 20: $3,000/month. Your income will 2-3x over 30
                    years. So should your investing.</p>
                <h3>Rule #7: Shift to Safety in Final Decade</h3>
                <p>At $8M, you don't need to risk everything on Tesla. <strong>Lock in gains</strong> by moving 50-60%
                    to bonds/index funds. Protect the win.</p>

                <h2><i class="fas fa-users"></i> Passing Wealth to the Next Generation</h2>
                <h3>Strategy #1: Roth IRA Inheritance (Tax-Free Dynasty)</h3>
                <p>If you die with $5M in a Roth IRA, your kids inherit it <strong>tax-free</strong>. They can stretch
                    withdrawals over 10 years. Generational gold mine.</p>
                <h3>Strategy #2: Step-Up Basis on Death</h3>
                <p>You bought Nvidia at $100, now worth $1,000. If you sell, you pay 20% tax on $900 gain.</p>
                <p>But if you die and <strong>pass it to your kids</strong>, their cost basis "steps up" to $1,000. They
                    can sell immediately with <strong>$0 capital gains tax</strong>.</p>
                <p class="highlight-text">This is why the ultra-wealthy never sell—they die and pass appreciated assets
                    to heirs.</p>
                <h3>Strategy #3: 529 Education Plans (Fund College Tax-Free)</h3>
                <p>Put $100K in a 529 plan. Invest in Bro stocks. By the time kids hit college (18 years), it's
                    $500K-1M. <strong>Tax-free withdrawals for education.</strong></p>
                <h3>Strategy #4: Revocable Trusts (Avoid Probate, Control Distribution)</h3>
                <p>Don't let a 22-year-old inherit $5M and blow it on Lambos. Set up a trust:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>$50K/year until age 30</li>
                    <li>$100K/year from 30-40</li>
                    <li>Full access at 40</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Protects wealth from bad decisions, divorces, lawsuits.</p>

                <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> The 5 Mistakes That Kill Generational Wealth</h2>
                <h3>1. Withdrawing Early (The $2M Mistake)</h3>
                <p>Pulling out $50K in Year 15 to buy a boat? That $50K would be $500K by Year 30. <strong>Don't touch
                        it.</strong></p>
                <h3>2. Panic Selling During Crashes</h3>
                <p>Selling at the bottom locks in permanent losses. <strong>Every crash recovers.</strong> Every.
                    Single. One.</p>
                <h3>3. Lifestyle Inflation</h3>
                <p>Making $200K/year but spending $190K? You'll never build wealth. <strong>Keep expenses at $120K,
                        invest the rest.</strong></p>
                <h3>4. Not Teaching Kids About Money</h3>
                <p>You build $10M, pass it to kids who blow it in 5 years. <strong>Teach them investing, compounding,
                        discipline.</strong> Wealth dies without education.</p>
                <h3>5. Trying to Time the Market</h3>
                <p>"I'll buy after the next crash." The crash comes, you get scared and wait more. Meanwhile, stock
                    3x's. <strong>Time in > timing the market.</strong></p>
