            <p class="article-text">January 2021. GameStop mania. I watched the stock go from $20 to $400. Every fiber of my being screamed to jump in. The momentum was undeniable. The FOMO was unbearable.</p>

            <p class="article-text">Three weeks later, it crashed to $40. The people who jumped in at $300+ lost 85% of their money. And I sat there, capital intact, ready for the real opportunities that came next.</p>

                        <strong>Reason:</strong> Can't verify balance sheet claims. When I can't audit the numbers, I don't trade the asset.<br><br>
                        <strong>Outcome:</strong> FTT went to $1.20. Avoided ~$19,000 loss on planned $20K position.<br>
                        <strong>Lesson Reinforced:</strong> Trust + Verify. If you can't verify, don't trust.

                        <strong>Outcome:</strong> SPY bottomed at $218 (only 7% more down) then rallied to $340 in months. A short here would have been crushed.<br>
                        <strong>Lesson Reinforced:</strong> Don't chase moves that have already happened.

                <p class="article-text">Your edge isn't in finding more trades. It's in <strong>filtering out the bad ones</strong> before they destroy your capital and confidence.</p>

                <p class="article-text">Every trade you don't take preserves capital for the one that matters. Every loss you avoid keeps you in the game. Every time you say "no" to a mediocre opportunity, you're saying "yes" to the great one that's coming.</p>
