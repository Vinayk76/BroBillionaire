                <p class="article-text">For eleven months, the strategy worked beautifully. 87% win rate. Average return: 2.1% per week. Members were making lakhs. The channel grew by 2,000 members every week.</p>

                <p class="article-text">Websites, courses, and gurus emerged to teach "The Wheel Strategy," "Iron Condors for Income," and "Selling Premium for Consistent Returns." Performance was amazing. Win rates of 80-90%. Monthly income streams.</p>

                        <p>VIX spiked 116% in one day. Every premium seller was short volatility. Every one of them was squeezed. ₹50 lakh accounts became ₹5 lakh accounts overnight.</p>

                <p class="article-text">The tragedy wasn't just the losses. It was the <strong>illusion of safety</strong> that preceded them. Premium selling worked for years — not because it was safe, but because volatility was suppressed. Traders confused a favorable environment for skill.</p>
