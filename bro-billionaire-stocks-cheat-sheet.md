## The 3 Golden Rules

### 1. Never Use Leverage/Margin
❌ "I'll borrow 50% to double my returns!"
✅ If you can't afford it with cash, don't buy it.

**Why:** These stocks can drop 50-75%. Leverage = margin call = forced liquidation at worst time.

### 2. Dollar-Cost Average (DCA)
❌ Trying to time the perfect bottom: "I'll buy Nvidia at $400" (never goes below $550)
✅ Split buys: Buy $2k every 2 weeks for 10 weeks

**Why:** Impossible to time bottom. DCA smooths entry.

### 3. Hold Minimum 3-5 Years
❌ Panic selling when position is down 40%
✅ Writing thesis, sizing for drawdowns, holding through pain

**Why:** Short-term = coin flip. Long-term = fundamentals win.

## How to Buy (India)

### Best Brokers:
1. **Vested Finance** - Zero commission, fractional shares, best for beginners
2. **INDMoney** - Zero commission, good UI, tax filing support
3. **ICICI Direct Global** - Traditional, higher fees ($15-25/trade)

### Requirements:
- PAN card
- Bank account
- LRS compliance (up to $250,000/year)
- TDS: 20% on capital gains + 4% cess

### Tax Treatment:
- **LTCG (>24 months):** 20% with indexation
- **STCG (<24 months):** Per your income tax slab
- **Currency risk:** INR-USD fluctuations affect returns

---

## When to SELL (Only 4 Reasons)

### 1. Fundamentals Deteriorate
- Losing market share to competitors
- Revenue growth slowing dramatically
- Management turmoil
**Example:** If Nvidia's GPU market share drops from 90% to 50%

### 2. Valuation Becomes Absurd
- 200x P/E with slowing growth
- Multiple expansion without fundamental improvement
**Example:** If Tesla trades at 150x P/E while EV sales decline

### 3. You Need the Money
- Emergency, life event, major purchase
**Note:** This is why you don't invest money you need short-term

### 4. Better Opportunity Emerges
- New disruptive company with higher potential
**Caution:** "Grass is greener" syndrome—be careful

### ⚠️ NEVER SELL Because:
- Stock is down 30-50% (volatility is normal)
- CNBC says it's overvalued
- Your friend/Reddit says to sell
- You're scared

## FAQ Speed-Round

**Q: Which one should I buy?**
A: Start with MSFT or AAPL (lowest volatility). Add NVDA if you can handle swings.

**Q: Are these stocks in a bubble?**
A: Some argue yes (high valuations). But AI, EVs, cloud are real trends. Size your position accordingly.

**Q: Should I sell if I'm up 100%?**
A: Depends. Billionaires hold for years. If thesis intact, hold. If valuation is insane, trim not dump.

**Q: I bought at the top, down 40%. What do I do?**
A: If fundamentals unchanged: HOLD or add more. If thesis broken: cut losses. Never hold "hoping."

**Q: Can I get rich with these?**
A: $10k → $250k happened (2,400% on NVDA). But required holding through -66% drawdown. Can YOU?

## The Uncomfortable Truth

Most people will NOT make money with these stocks.

**Why?**
1. Panic sell at -50%
2. Buy at tops with FOMO
3. Overleverage and get margin-called
4. Don't understand the business
5. Have no conviction to hold

**Billionaires make money because:**
1. They research deeply (conviction)
2. They size properly (can survive drawdowns)
3. They hold for years (not months)
4. They add during crashes (when others sell)
