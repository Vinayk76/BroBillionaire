            <h2>What is Gratuity?</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Gratuity</strong> is a monetary benefit given by an employer to an employee for the services rendered during employment. It is a token of appreciation paid at the time of retirement, resignation, or death. Gratuity is governed by the <strong>Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972</strong> in India.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>Key Point:</strong> Gratuity is a defined benefit plan, meaning the employer must pay it regardless of profits. It is calculated based on your last drawn salary and years of service.
            </div>
            
            <h3>Gratuity Eligibility Criteria</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Minimum 5 years of continuous service</strong> with the same employer</li>
                <li>Applicable to organizations with <strong>10 or more employees</strong></li>
                <li>In case of <strong>death or disability</strong>, gratuity is payable even before completing 5 years</li>
                <li>The 5-year rule can be relaxed if service is more than <strong>4 years and 6 months</strong> (rounded to 5 years)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Gratuity Calculation Formula</h3>
            
            <p>There are two formulas depending on whether you're covered under the Payment of Gratuity Act:</p>
            
            <div class="formula-box">
                <strong>Covered under Act (10+ employees):</strong><br>
                Gratuity = (Last Salary × 15 × Years of Service) ÷ 26
            </div>
            
            <div class="formula-box">
                <strong>Not Covered under Act:</strong><br>
                Gratuity = (Last Salary × 15 × Years of Service) ÷ 30
            </div>
            
            <p><strong>Where:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Last Salary</strong> = Basic Salary + Dearness Allowance (DA)</li>
                <li><strong>15</strong> = Number of days of salary per year</li>
                <li><strong>26</strong> = Working days in a month (for covered employees)</li>
                <li><strong>30</strong> = Days in a month (for non-covered employees)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Gratuity Tax Rules 2026</h3>
            <table class="comparison-table">
                <tr>
                    <th>Employee Type</th>
                    <th>Tax-Exempt Limit</th>
                    <th>Taxable Amount</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Government Employees</td>

                    <td>₹20,00,000</td>
                    <td>Amount above ₹20 lakh</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Private (Not Covered)</td>
                    <td>Least of: Actual, ₹20 lakh, or Calculated</td>
                    <td>Amount above exempt limit</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>Tax Tip:</strong> If you receive gratuity from multiple employers in your career, the total exemption across all is still capped at ₹20 lakh. Any gratuity received above this cumulative limit is taxable.
            </div>
            
            <h3>Gratuity Example Calculation</h3>
            <p>Let's calculate gratuity for an employee with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic Salary: ₹60,000/month</li>
                <li>DA: ₹10,000/month</li>
                <li>Years of Service: 12 years 8 months (rounded to 13 years)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="formula-box">
                Gratuity = (70,000 × 15 × 13) ÷ 26 = <strong>₹5,25,000</strong>
            </div>
            
            <p>Since ₹5,25,000 is below ₹20 lakh limit, the entire amount is <strong>tax-free</strong>.</p>
            
            <h3>When is Gratuity Paid?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Retirement</strong> - At the time of superannuation</li>
                <li><strong>Resignation</strong> - After completing 5 years of service</li>
                <li><strong>Death</strong> - Paid to nominee/legal heir (no 5-year requirement)</li>
                <li><strong>Disability</strong> - Due to accident or illness (no 5-year requirement)</li>
                <li><strong>Termination</strong> - If not for misconduct and after 5 years</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Gratuity Forfeiture Rules</h3>
            <p>An employer can forfeit gratuity (fully or partially) if the employee is terminated for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Riotous or disorderly conduct</li>
                <li>Any act of violence</li>
                <li>Any act which constitutes an offense involving moral turpitude</li>
                <li>Causing damage to employer's property (to the extent of damage)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="faq-section">

                        Is gratuity mandatory for employers?

                        Yes, gratuity is mandatory for all establishments with 10 or more employees at any point during the year. Once the Act applies, it continues to apply even if employee count falls below 10. For smaller organizations, gratuity may be offered as per company policy.

                        If your employer refuses or delays gratuity payment, you can file a complaint with the Controlling Authority (usually the Labour Commissioner) of your region. The employer must pay within 30 days of it becoming payable. Non-payment attracts simple interest at 10% per annum.

                        Service period is calculated from the date of joining to the date of leaving. Months over 6 are rounded up to the next year (e.g., 10 years 7 months = 11 years for calculation). Months 6 or less are ignored. Approved leaves and breaks don't affect continuous service.

                        Gratuity is a one-time lump sum payment at the end of employment based on tenure and last salary. Pension is a periodic payment (usually monthly) for life after retirement. Gratuity is governed by the Gratuity Act, while pensions are governed by separate pension schemes (like NPS, EPF).
