Hi [Name],

I'm a regular reader of [Their Blog] - really enjoyed your recent piece on [specific article they wrote].

I recently published an in-depth analysis of the "Magnificent 7" tech stocks: Meta, Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Tesla.

[Link to article]

Key findings:

## 📧 Template 4: Guest Post Pitch

**Subject**: Guest post idea: "The $250B AI Spending Question"

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

Love [Their Publication] - been following for [timeframe].

I'd love to contribute a guest post. I recently analyzed the Magnificent 7 tech stocks and found some surprising insights that would resonate with your audience.

**Proposed Title**: "Are Tech Giants Overinvesting in AI? A $250 Billion Analysis"

**Angle**: Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, and Tesla are collectively spending $250B on AI infrastructure this year. Historical precedents (1990s telecom fiber) suggest collective overinvestment can destroy value even when the technology works. I break down the bull vs. bear case with data.

**Why your readers will love it**:
• Contrarian take backed by data
• Actionable insights (which stocks to buy, hold, trim)
• 8-10 minute read
• Original research and DCF models

I've already published a version on my site [link], but I can create a unique angle specifically for [Their Publication] (different focus, updated data, custom graphics).

What do you think? Would this fit your editorial calendar?

## 📧 Template 10: Forum/Community Value Add

**For posting in finance forums, Reddit, etc.**

**Title**: "I analyzed $15.8T in tech stocks. Here's what I found."

**Body**:
```
Hey everyone,

I spent 3 weeks analyzing the "Magnificent 7" tech stocks (Meta, Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla) and wanted to share my findings.

**TL;DR**: Only 2 of 7 are undervalued. The rest are pricing in perfect execution with zero margin for error.

**Key insights**:
1. Concentration risk unprecedented (42% of S&P 500)
2. $250B collective AI capex = prisoner's dilemma
3. Only Alphabet and Meta trade below DCF fair value
4. Nvidia (-31%) and Tesla (-48%) significantly overvalued
5. Regulatory risks 65% likely by 2027

I broke down:
• Full bull case (why they could keep running)
• Full bear case (why this could end badly)
• Valuation models for each stock
• AI spending risk analysis
• Regulatory threat assessment

Full write-up here: [Link]

Happy to answer questions on methodology or any of the stocks.

What's your take? Am I being too bearish?
