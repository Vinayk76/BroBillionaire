                In 1979, two oil billionaires from Texas hatched an audacious plan: corner the entire global silver market. 
                What followed was a parabolic rise, a government intervention, and the most spectacular commodity bust in history. 
                This is the story of "Silver Thursday."

                <p class="article-text">The Hunts weren't just panic-buying. They had a <strong>thesis</strong> — and on paper, it was actually quite compelling:</p>

                        <h4>Supply Deficit</h4>
                        <p>Industrial demand for silver (photography, electronics, medicine) exceeded mine production every year. The deficit was filled by government stockpile sales — but those stockpiles were shrinking fast.</p>

                        <h4>Monetary History</h4>
                        <p>Silver was money for 5,000 years. The historical gold-to-silver ratio was 15:1. In 1979, it was 40:1. By that math, silver was massively undervalued.</p>

                        <h4>Inflation Hedge</h4>
                        <p>With inflation at 13%+, hard assets were the only protection. Silver had intrinsic value that paper dollars lacked.</p>

                        <h4>Small Market</h4>
                        <p>Unlike gold, the silver market was tiny — easy to move, and theoretically... easy to corner.</p>
