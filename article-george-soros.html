His father, a POW survivor from World War I, knew how to navigate danger. He obtained false papers for the entire family.</p>
                
                <p class="article-text">While other families hesitated, Tivadar Soros taught his son a lesson that would shape his entire trading philosophy: <span class="gold-text">When survival is at stake, act decisively. Waiting for certainty can kill you.</span></p>

                <p class="article-text">After the war, Soros emigrated to England with nothing. He worked as a railway porter and a waiter while studying at the London School of Economics. There, he discovered philosophy — particularly the work of Karl Popper — which would later become the foundation of his trading strategy.</p>
