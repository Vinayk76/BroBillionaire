            <h2>What is PPF (Public Provident Fund)?</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Public Provident Fund (PPF)</strong> is a government-backed savings scheme introduced in 1968. It is one of the safest investment options in India, offering guaranteed returns and complete tax exemption under the EEE (Exempt-Exempt-Exempt) category.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>Key Benefit:</strong> PPF offers triple tax benefits — your investment is tax-deductible under Section 80C (up to ₹1.5 lakh), the interest earned is tax-free, and the maturity amount is completely tax-exempt.
            </div>
            
            <h3>PPF Interest Rate History</h3>
            <table class="comparison-table">

            <h3>How PPF Interest is Calculated</h3>
            <p>PPF interest is calculated on the <strong>lowest balance between the 5th and the last day of each month</strong>. This means if you want to maximize your interest, you should deposit your money before the 5th of each month.</p>
            
            <p>The formula for PPF interest calculation is:</p>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>Interest = P × r × n/12</strong><br>
                Where P = Principal, r = Annual interest rate, n = Number of months
            </div>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Partial Withdrawal:</strong> Allowed from 7th financial year onwards. You can withdraw up to 50% of the balance at the end of the 4th year or the previous year (whichever is lower).</li>
                <li><strong>Loan Against PPF:</strong> Available from 3rd to 6th financial year. Maximum loan amount is 25% of the balance at the end of the 2nd preceding year.</li>
                <li><strong>Premature Closure:</strong> Only allowed after 5 years under specific conditions (serious illness, higher education, NRI status change).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Who Should Invest in PPF?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Conservative Investors:</strong> If you prefer guaranteed returns over market-linked risks.</li>
                <li><strong>Retirement Planning:</strong> PPF is excellent for building a tax-free retirement corpus.</li>
                <li><strong>Tax Savers:</strong> If you want to maximize Section 80C benefits with tax-free returns.</li>
                <li><strong>Long-term Savers:</strong> If you can commit money for 15+ years without needing it.</li>
                <li><strong>Parents:</strong> You can open a PPF account for minor children (counts under parent's 80C limit).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> To maximize returns, invest your yearly amount as a lump sum before April 5th. This ensures you earn interest for the entire financial year on your full investment.

                        The minimum annual investment in PPF is ₹500, and the maximum is ₹1,50,000 per financial year. You can invest in lump sum or up to 12 installments per year. If you invest less than ₹500, your account will become inactive.

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        No, PPF enjoys EEE (Exempt-Exempt-Exempt) tax status. Your investment qualifies for Section 80C deduction (up to ₹1.5 lakh), the interest earned is tax-free, and the maturity amount is also completely tax-free. This makes PPF one of the most tax-efficient investments in India.

                        NRIs cannot open new PPF accounts. However, if you had a PPF account as a resident and later became an NRI, you can continue the account until maturity but cannot extend it beyond 15 years. The account will continue to earn interest.

                        Yes, you can extend your PPF account in blocks of 5 years indefinitely. You can choose to extend with or without fresh contributions. You must submit Form H within one year of maturity to extend with contributions, otherwise it will be extended without contributions.
