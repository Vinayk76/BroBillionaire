                <p class="article-text">His father wanted him to be a farmer. But Jesse had discovered something that changed his life — a small chalkboard at a local brokerage showing stock prices.</p>
                
                <p class="article-text">He was mesmerized. Not by the money, but by the <span class="gold-text">patterns in the numbers</span>. He got a job as a "chalkboard boy," writing stock quotes for $6 a week. But he wasn't just writing — he was studying.</p>

                </blockquote>

                <p class="article-text">While other boys his age were playing games, Jesse was filling notebooks with price movements, looking for patterns that repeated. He discovered that markets move in predictable ways — if you know what to look for.</p>

                <p class="article-text">By 16, he was so good at predicting prices that "bucket shops" (illegal gambling houses for stocks) <strong>banned him</strong>. He had to wear disguises just to keep trading.</p>
