                <p class="article-text">In 1966, a 17-year-old kid named Richard Dennis borrowed <strong>$400</strong> from his family. He wasn't buying a car or saving for college. He was about to start trading commodities at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.</p>
                
                <p class="article-text">There was just one problem — you had to be 21 to trade. So Richard did what any determined teenager would do: he got his father to stand in the trading pit and execute orders while he called them out from the sidelines.</p>
                
                <p class="article-text">That $400? He turned it into <span class="gold-text">$200 million</span> over the next two decades.</p>
                
                <blockquote class="article-quote">
                    <div class="quote-icon"><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i></div>
                    <p>"I always say you could publish trading rules in the newspaper and no one would follow them. The key is consistency and discipline."</p>
                    <cite>— Richard Dennis</cite>
                </blockquote>

                <p class="article-text">Richard wasn't just lucky. He developed a <strong>systematic approach</strong> to trading that took all emotion out of the equation. While other traders panicked and made rash decisions, Richard followed his rules like a robot.</p>
                
                <p class="article-text">By his mid-twenties, people on the trading floor were calling him <strong>"Prince of the Pit"</strong> — and he was worth more than most would earn in ten lifetimes.</p>

                <div class="chapter-number">02</div>
                <h2 class="chapter-title">The Million Dollar Bet 🐢</h2>
                
                <p class="article-text">In 1983, Richard Dennis had a debate with his longtime trading partner, William Eckhardt. The argument was simple but profound:</p>
                
                <div class="info-cards-grid">
                    <div class="info-card">
                        <div class="info-card-icon"><i class="fas fa-dna"></i></div>
                        <h4>Eckhardt's View</h4>
                        <p>"Great traders are <strong>born</strong>, not made. You can't teach talent."</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="info-card">
                        <div class="info-card-icon"><i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i></div>
                        <h4>Dennis's View</h4>
                        <p>"Anyone can be taught to trade. It's about <strong>rules</strong>, not talent."</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p class="article-text">Richard was so confident that he proposed a real experiment: <strong>recruit random people, teach them his trading system in just two weeks, give them real money, and see if they could profit.</strong></p>
                
                <p class="article-text">But why "Turtles"? 🐢</p>
                
                <p class="article-text">During this time, Richard had visited a turtle farm in Singapore where they bred turtles for profit. Watching rows and rows of baby turtles being raised, he had an epiphany:</p>
                
                <blockquote class="article-quote">
                    <div class="quote-icon"><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i></div>
                    <p>"We are going to grow traders just like they grow turtles in Singapore."</p>
                    <cite>— Richard Dennis</cite>
                </blockquote>
                
                <p class="article-text">And so, the most famous trading experiment in history got its name.</p>

                        <p itemprop="text">Most successful traders take 2-3 years of consistent practice to become profitable. This includes learning, paper trading, losing money on small positions, and developing a personalized system. Studies show only 1-3% of day traders are profitable after 5 years. Expect to pay 'tuition' to the market.</p>

SEBI's 2023 study found 93% of Indian F&O traders lost money with ₹1.81 lakh average loss. Day trading is harder - only 1% profitable. The odds improve for swing traders and investors with longer timeframes.</p>
